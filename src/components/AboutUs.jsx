              This platform is designed to help users connect with Bhojpuri
              Gayak, allowing them to schedule performances for particular dates
              and times. Gayaks have the freedom to either accept or decline
              performance requests, and there is also an opportunity for
              individuals to register as Bhojpuri Gayak. The platform includes
              detailed information about scheduled Bhopuri performances,
              ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for both organizers and
              artists.
